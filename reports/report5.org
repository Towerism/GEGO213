* Background
I chose to evaluate an oxbow lake associated with the Red River, specifically
the one located near Burneyville, Oklahoma. In Texas, it is the second longest
river cite:tsharedriver. The river is called red because of red soil that the
river tends to carry during times of flood cite:tsharedriver. The Red River has
many forks, but its source is located in Curry County, New Mexico, and drains in
the Mississippi drainage basin cite:tsharedriver.
* Oxbow Lake
The selected oxbow lake is located near Burneyville, Oklahoma and is associated
with the Red River as suggested by the lecture slides. This particular location
seems to be one of multiple oxbow lakes over the course of possibly
decades. This is evidenced by scarring that may have been left behind by
previous oxbow lakes as seen in figure ref:img-2005.
* Changes Over Time
Figure ref:img-2005 shows the oxbow lake in 1995. It is starting to fill up with
sediment. The oxbow lake also has forks on its west side where the oxbow lake
splits off into what look like tendrils. At this stage, it is also obvious, from
the scarring shown in the picture, that there have been multiple oxbow lakes at
this location in the past. Figure ref:img-2006 shows the oxbow lake
in 2006. Vegetation has started growing, more sediment is building up, and the
forks and scarring have become less prominent. Figure ref:img-2010 shows the
oxbow lake in 2010. The oxbow lake is becoming thinner as more sediment builds
up, more vegetation is growing over the oxbow lake, and the forks are no longer
visible. Figure ref:img-2016 shows the oxbow lake in 2016. Compared to 2006 and
1995, there is a significant amount of sediment left behind by the meandering
river itself indicating it may be on its way to form a new oxbow lake in the
future. The current oxbow lake at this point is nearly covered in
vegetation. The url used for the images is:

* Future
The oxbow lake is already almost completely covered with vegetation. This is due
to sediment building up from the red river spilling over into oxbow lake, slowly
filling in the oxbow lake over time. As the lake fills in with more sediment, it
will gradually disappear as more and more vegetation grows over the
sediment-filled in oxbow lake. In the future one may not even be able to tell
that there was even an oxbow lake there at one time.
