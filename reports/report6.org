* Abstract
Mount Pinatubo, once dormant for 500 years, erupted violently in 1991 resulting
in one of the biggest eruptions of the 20th century. The eruption was so
disastrous that not only its ability to physically change the surrounding
landscape but also its life threatening hazards have been felt years after. Deep
valleys were filled by pyroclastic flows, and several villages were run over by
lahars.
* Background
Before its cataclysmic volcanic activity which began to surface in March of
1991, Mount Pinatubo had been enjoying a period of dormancy which lasted about 500
years cite:usgspinatubo. Part of the aggravation that led to this disaster may
have been a magnitude 7.8 earthquake that occurred on the Philippine island of
Luzon 60 miles away from Mount Pinatubo about a year before its eruption
cite:usgspinatubo. Initially, the volcanic activity consisted of powerful steam
explosions and magma rising slowly at the surface cite:usgspinatubo. This
changed on June 15, when the volcano erupted violently and sent large amounts of
volcanic material into the atmosphere, marking one of the biggest volcanic
eruptions of the twentieth century. Ash continued to occasionally spew out
from the volcano up until September of that year cite:usgspinatubo.
* Data, Imagery, Destruction
Luckily, scientists had forecast this event so the damage that would have
occurred was somewhat prevented cite:usgspinatubo. Although 5,000 lives were
saved and $250 million in property damage was prevented, the eruption still
caused $100 million in aircraft damages and devastated two of the largest
U.S. military bases in the Philippines cite:usgspinatubo.

As much as 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide was emitted during the eruption,
causing temperatures to drop worldwide for two years by half of a degree Celsius
cite:usgspinatubo. Figure ref:img-ashcloud shows an ash cloud over Mount
Pinatubo resulting from its first eruption in 500 years.

Disastrous pyroclastic flows seemed to completely fill deep valleys
cite:usgspinatubo. Even a half decade or more later, the deposits left over from
the pyroclastic flows have remained very hot, with temperatures reaching more
than 400 degrees Celsius cite:usgspinatubo. The intense heat causes explosions
sending ash into the atmosphere whenever groundwater or streams come into
contact with the deposits cite:usgspinatubo. It is ash deposits such as these
that are swept away during heavy rains causing lahars that have buried several
villages and crop fields cite:usgspinatubo. Figure ref:img-lahar-village shows
such a village.

Although thousands of lives were saved, hundreds of thousands of the people of
the Philippines were dislocated cite:usgspinatubo. Those whose homes were not
erased by lahars have been able to return home, albeit under the threat of
future lahars cite:usgspinatubo.

* Conclusion
The eruption of Mount Pinatubo was a cataclysmic event causing drastic change in
landscape and displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. The eruption was
so disastrous that its life threatening effects have been felt years after. Deep
valleys were filled by pyroclastic flows, and several villages were run over by
lahars. This merely goes to show that no matter how long a volcano has been
dormant, it might erupt any day. Recall that the Pompeiians and Herculaneans
buried under the ashes of the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD
were not even aware that it was a volcano because it had not erupted in
centuries, even longer than Mount Pinatubo had gone before it erupted again
cite:sutherlandmarvels. Technology today, however, seems to be sophisticated
enough to show when a volcano is expected to erupt allowing adequate time to
make preparations.
