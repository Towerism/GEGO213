* Abstract
While it is easy to explain away the rapid retreat of the Columbia Glacier in
Alaska as a result of mere melting, the explanation of why Columbia has
retreated more than 20 kilometers is much more complicated than that. It
involves not only climate but also glacier dynamics. Once the terminus of
Columbia had begun to slip into the Prince William Sound, the glacier embarked
on a rapid recession.

* Background
The Columbia Glacier, a tidewater glacier located in Alaska north of the Prince
William Sound and today the fastest moving glacier in the world
cite:enncolumbia, reaches more than 3 kilometers above sea level
cite:earthobscolumbia. Decades ago, it once reached the northern tip of Heather
island but has since retreated northward more than 20 kilometers
cite:earthobscolumbia. Today, tons of ice are breaking off of the glacier by the
millions daily cite:alaskaorgcolumbia.

* Data, Imagery, Change
Since 1986, the Columbia Glacier has receded more than 20 kilometers and has
become substantially smaller in both thickness and volume
cite:earthobscolumbia. Figure ref:img-before shows Columbia before its
retreat. The retreat and thinning is due mostly to glacier dynamics. Figure
ref:img-during-1 shows the terminus, or nose, starting to slip into the Prince
William Sound. This slippage most likely started due to the melting of the
terminal moraine, which had developed over decades holding the ice in place
cite:scilogscolumbia. Once the terminus of the glacier began to slip past the
moraine the glacier simply began to slowly break off into the Prince William
Sound cite:evolvingretreat. Figure ref:img-during shows the terminus nearly
gone, while figure ref:img-after shows Columbia after the terminus had vanished
completely.

* Conclusion
The recession of Columbia is not due to mere melting. It involves not only
climate but also glacier dynamics. In fact, the retreat and thinning is due
mostly to glacier dynamics. Once the terminus began to slip past the moraine
which had been holding the ice in place, the glacier simply began to slowly
break off into the Prince William Sound.
